While we have Alice's cause against a repressive non-democratic regime in mind 
when designing technologies like these, we must also consider that these 
technologies can be used by people with less amicable causes.
For example, these technologies might just as well be used by a fascist 
minority planning an attack against a democratic government.
As this type of tool benefits all people, it will inevitably also benefit those 
who want to coordinate actions against those in power --- be it the majority of 
the people in the case of democracy or a minority in the case of an 
authoritarian elite.
But if we consider that \SI{55}{\%} of the countries of the world are still 
non-free~\cite{FreedomInTheWorld2017}, we believe that any research in this 
direction will do more good than harm.

%According to \textcite{OurWorldInData-Terrorism} there were 13\,000 deaths 
%caused by terrorism in 2010.
%They compare this to deaths caused by interpersonal violence, 535\,000 cases
%in 2008, and road traffic accidents, 1\,209\,000 cases in 2008\footnote{%
%  In 2015, this number had increased to 1\,340\,000 deaths worldwide caused by 
%  road injuries~\cite{WHODeathStats}.
%}.
%We would thus prevent far more deaths by abolishing automobiles than we would 
%by preventing terrorism entirely --- including the terrorism planned using 
%\acp{PET}.
