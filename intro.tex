\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

Online technologies are used more and more by citizens all over the world.
This is both good and bad.
The bad thing is that there are more data stored in these online services than 
ever and these data are used by oppressive regimes against the citizens using 
them.
The good thing is that there are technologies which remedy some of the problems 
and that researchers are trying to remedy the rest of the problems.

We will focus on the broad category of \acp{OSN} in this context.
Most of these services are today run in a centralized manner, i.e.\ the 
provider of the service acts as the communication channel between the users.
Such a hub structure allows the providers to oversee a large amount of 
information, and in the case of \acp{OSN}, much of it is of personal and 
sensitive kind ---  e.g.\ planning of events or geolocated pictures which 
reveal physical positions.
This also makes these providers the target of attackers who want to get those 
data:
as we have seen in the media of recent years, the security agencies of many 
countries also target these services to gain information about their 
citizens~\cite{Prism}.

We can conclude that we need strong privacy properties for online technologies 
to protect citizens in all countries of the world.
One interesting branch of research is decentralized \acp{PET}.
Decentralized solutions yield provider independence and censorship resistance.
Privacy-preserving solutions provide data protection by prevention, e.g.\ by 
cryptographic means rather than that some organization must maintain a secure 
system.

This chapter focuses on technical tools that can be useful for protesting.
We focus on privacy-preserving tools that exist in the research literature of 
the security and privacy field but have not yet seen widespread use in practice 
and some future research directions.
Protesting can be done physically, as we have known protests traditionally, 
they can also be done purely online in the form of \enquote{petitions} or, more 
generally, by expressing support for an expressed opinion.
The petitions can be seen as the problem of electronic voting, we can transform 
the petition into a vote.
This would not be straight-forward and would include interesting research 
problems to be solved, however, we will not discuss this in the chapter.
The more general case of expressing support for an expressed opinion is 
something that can be done using social media, which is more related to the 
\ac{OSN} mechanisms that we will discuss.
We will focus on the latter, and especially its use related to physical 
protests.

We categorize the topics we will cover as useful before, under or after 
a protest.
The before stage treats problems related to how to organize a public protest, 
this is discussed in \cref{BeforeProtest}.
The problems in the during the protest, e.g.\ how the organizers and 
participants can communicate securely within the group or to the outside world, 
is treated in \cref{DuringProtest}.
Finally, in the after stage we are interested in achieving different 
authenticity and verifiability properties, e.g.\ possibly following up an event 
by verifying the participation and computing verifiable statistics, such as how 
many participants and in what area.
This is treated in \cref{AfterProtest}.
Some tools are of course useful in more than one stage, so the categorization 
is not strict in that sense.
Furthermore, some tools that are useful afterwards requires us to perform some 
action during the protest, we will cover such a topic as a unit and simply 
point out what must be performed during and what must be done after the 
protest.

Before we begin our treatment of what was just outlined, there are two 
fundamental problems that we must discuss.
These are the problem of double agents and the problem of Sybil attacks.
