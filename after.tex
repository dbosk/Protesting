\section{After a Protest}
\label{AfterProtest}

The main goal after a protest is to provide verifiable data.
For instance, how can we ensure that photos from a demonstration are authentic?
We can probably recognize the place the photo is portraying, however, the 
meta-data such as time-stamps of the file can be manipulated.
So the only thing we can say is that the photo was taken at the latest at the 
time of publication.
Similarly, how can we determine the number of participants of a demonstration?
Many techniques used today estimate the number given photos of the 
demonstration, but this might not give an accurate number.
And, as mentioned, the source of the photo must be trusted, otherwise the 
authenticity of the photo can be questioned.

We will discuss these two problems in this section.
First we will discuss the problem of data authenticity in 
\cref{DataAuthenticity}, i.e.\ that the data can be correctly tied to the 
demonstration.
Then we will discuss verification of the participation of a protest in 
\cref{ProtestVerif}, i.e.\ the ability to compute and verify the number of 
participants.

%use it as feedback into a reputation system;
