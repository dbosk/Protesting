\section{After a Protest}
\label{AfterProtest}

As we pointed out earlier, the main goal of the stage after a protest is to 
provide verifiable data.
For instance, how can we ensure that photos from a demonstration are authentic?
We can probably recognize the place the photo is portraying, however, the time 
data of the file can be manipulated.
Similarly, how can we determine the number of participants of a demonstration?
We might be able to estimate the number given photos of the demonstration, but 
this might not give an accurate number, especially since the authenticity of 
the photos can be questioned.
We will discuss two problems in this section:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ensuring data authenticity related to a demonstration, e.g.\ so that 
    the data can be correctly tied to the demonstration;
  %\item the possibilities for the organizers to verify the participation and 
  %use it as feedback into a reputation system;
  \item third-party verification of the authenticity of the participation of 
    a protest, e.g.\ compute the number of participants.
\end{enumerate}

These problems will be discussed in \cref{DataAuthenticicty,ProtestVerif}, 
respectively.
