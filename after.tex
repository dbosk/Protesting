\section{After a Protest}
\label{AfterProtest}

The main goal for Alice after a protest is to provide verifiable data.
For instance, how can she ensure that photos from a demonstration are 
authentic?
We can probably recognize the place the photo is portraying, however, the 
meta-data such as time-stamps of the file can be manipulated.
So the only thing we can say for sure is that the photo was taken at the latest 
at the time of publication.
Similarly, how can we determine the number of participants of a demonstration?
Many techniques used today estimate the number given photos of the 
demonstration, but this might not give an accurate number.
And, as mentioned, the source of each photo must be trusted, otherwise the 
authenticity of the photos can be questioned.
Alice also has another problem.
Assume that she can provide this verifiable data.
Alice and Bob do not want that Eve can use this data to tie Alice
and Bob to the demonstration and arrest them.
Thus, what Alice and Bob need is a system which can provide data authenticity 
and user privacy, i.e.\ that the data can be correctly tied to the 
demonstration without outing Alice and Bob as supporters.
Then we will discuss verification of the participation of a protest, i.e.\ the 
ability to compute and verify the number of participants while preserving the 
privacy of Alice and Bob.
