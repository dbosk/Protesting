\citet{PPACforPubFS} analysed two dichotomous models of communication.
The first was the pull model, where the recipients fetch (i.e.\ pull) new 
messages from the sender.
A suitable analogy would be that of magazines published through sales in 
kiosks: people go to the kiosk to get the latest publications.
The second model was the push model, here a sender sends the message directly 
to the recipients.
Thus it is more like magazine subscriptions: the next issue arrives in the 
mailbox shortly after publication.
This is the model of the communication described in \cref{GroupProperties}.
\citeauthor{PPACforPubFS} found that achieving privacy in the pull model is 
technically easier than in the push model.
In fact, achieving privacy in the push model is very difficult.

\paragraph{Pull Model}
We can start by looking at the pull model for communication.
Alice wants to distribute a message to the participants in a discussion.
In the pull model the participants actively ask Alice or a mediary for new 
messages at regular intervals.
To form a protocol around this model, Alice and the participants can agree on 
a location for the messages.
When Alice wants to send a new message, she writes it to this particular 
location.
When the other participants want to, they can read from the location to see if 
there are any new messages.

We can assume that the network that Alice uses is controlled by the regime's 
agents.
We can also assume that the storage where the messages are stored is publicly 
readable, because it is probable that the regime's agents can compromise it.
Thus Alice does not want to be associated with the message, not authorship nor 
posting it.

The first thing we can say about this is that Alice would like to have 
confidentiality for the message contents, so the regime's agents cannot read 
it.
She would also like to have integrity for the message, so that the recipients 
can be sure that the regime's agents have not modified it.
Many systems provide these two properties, e.g.\ \ac{PGP} which is used for 
email.
However, Alice also wants to hide the sender and recipients, a property which 
\ac{PGP} and others do not provide.
There is a class of encryption schemes called \ac{ANOBE} schemes.
This type of scheme provides confidentiality while hiding the sender and the 
intended recipients.
If Alice can write the message anonymously to the storage and the message is 
encrypted using \iac{ANOBE} scheme, then it will be difficult to determine the 
sender.
Furthermore, if the recipients fetch the messages anonymously too, then the 
recipients are also hidden.
Now the problem of integrity remains.
If Alice and the other participants agree on a commonly shared \ac{MA} key, 
then they can use \acp{MAC} to ensure integrity.
The reason \acp{MAC} are more desirable than digital signatures in this 
situations is that anyone who can verify the authenticity of \iac{MAC} can also 
create one.
With digital signatures on the other hand, if Alice signs a message it is clear 
that Alice is the only one who could have signed it.
With \acp{MAC}, any of the other participants could also be the author of the 
message.
This means that for a discussion, any of the participants would be equally 
likely to be the author of a given message.

\paragraph{Push Model}
Now to the push model, \dots
