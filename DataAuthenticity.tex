\citet{PPACforPubFS} presents work done in the area of privacy-preserving 
access control in distributed storage systems.
This is important since it outlines some possibilities and limits for such 
systems.
The problem in this scenario is that we don't want to be identifiable as 
a demonstrator, as this might yield repercussions.
Thus we can to share the data anonymously, no one can tell with whom we've 
shared what or if they've read it.
However, we still want to verify authenticity as it might otherwise be the 
regime spreading disinformation.

In this case it is also not straight forward to just apply the techniques in 
\cite{OTPKX} to achieve deniability.
