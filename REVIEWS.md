Feedback/review on proposal

    "Particular to your abstract we found that it may be the case of narrowing 
    down a bit the scope of the chapter as it feels still a bit too broad.  It 
    is also important to bare in mind the book will be read by a very 
    heterogeneous audience, from all sort of social studies background. The 
    text should thus should be accessible as possible and proofread before 
    submission."
