\section{Technical limitations}

We can only do so much with technology, and, of course, there are some 
limitations to what technical solutions can achieve.
In particular, we face two problems.
The first one, the double agent problem, is caused by humans ability to deceive 
each other, and consequently cannot easily be solved by technology.
The second one, the Sybil attack, is a consequence of the unlimited ability of creating 
arbitrary identities in online systems such as social networks.

\label{DoubleAgentProblem}
The double agent problem is the problem of one of the regime's agents 
infiltrating the opposition by acting as if part of the opposition.
We cannot solve this problem, however, we might be able to reduce the damage.
One design principle for privacy is data minimization, this strategy will help 
Alice reduce the information that the double agent, and anyone else, can learn.
