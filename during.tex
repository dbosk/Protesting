\section{During a Protest}
\label{DuringProtest}

During a protest, organizers and demonstrators might want to communicate, 
either among themselves or to the outside world.
The communication to the outside world can have at least two purposes.
The first one is simply to try to get more people to come to the demonstration.
The second is when a demonstrator wants to store something for posterity.
This can be a photo capturing police brutality or a part of 
a proof-of-demonstration (as in \cref{AfterProtest}).
There are a few problems that must be considered for communication during 
a protest.

If the participants use the phone network, i.e.\ infrastructure which is 
generally controlled by the government, participants can be tracked and bound 
to the location through their phone.
Thus using the phone network for communication is not an option if there is 
a risk for tracking and reprimands.
If they communicate over the phone network they can still use the techniques 
outlined in \cref{BeforeProtest}, but this only protects the communication --- 
it does not prevent the government from learning that a specific phone was 
present.

If they do not want to be tracked, there are two options:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item they must use another network infrastructure that is not controlled by 
    the government,
  \item the mechanisms in \cref{BeforeProtest,AfterProtest} must allow 
    executions without access to a global communications infrastructure during 
    the demonstration, i.e.\ they must be asynchronous.
\end{enumerate}
There are solutions to the first options: mobile ad-hoc networks.

For the second option listed above, we can achieve local communication, e.g.\ 
pairwise communication through bluetooth or \ac{NFC}.
However, communicating certain data to the outside world will still be the 
ultimate goal, but with this option there is at least the possibility to use 
the local communication possibilities in \cref{AfterProtest}.
