\section{After a Protest}
\label{AfterProtest}

One problem in real-world demonstrations that has not yet been entirely solved 
is the crowd-counting problem, i.e.\ the verification of the participation in 
a demonstration.
After many demonstrations the count by police and that by the organizers 
differ, in some instances the difference can be hundreds of thousands.
There are numerous examples, e.g.\ the demonstrations in South 
Korea~\cite{2016DemonstrationsInSeoul} or the women's marches in the 
US~\cite{2017WomensMarchesInUS}, where there is difficulty in establishing the 
actual number of participants.
The methods for counting the crowds vary.
There are some techniques using computer vision found in the research 
literature, e.g.\ by~\textcite{CVCrowdCounting}.
These require images from the demonstration and provide no way to verify the 
authenticity of the count (except re-running the algorithm on one's own input 
data).
However, as is illustrated by 
\textcite{2016DemonstrationsInSeoul,2017WomensMarchesInUS}, the methods used in 
practice are manual and prone to errors.

The main goal for Alice after a protest is to provide verifiable data.
For example, how can she ensure that photos from a demonstration are authentic?
We can probably recognize the place the photo is portraying, however, this 
might just as well be a reconstruction or entirely computer generated.
We cannot trust the meta-data of the photo, such as time-stamps of the file, 
because these can easily be manipulated.
So the only thing we can say for sure is that the photo was taken at the latest 
at the time of publication.
Now, if we cannot trust these photos, how can we determine the number of 
participants of a demonstration?
Many of the techniques require photos for doing this.
Furthermore, as is shown by 
\textcite{2016DemonstrationsInSeoul,2017WomensMarchesInUS}, the numbers 
determined by these techniques have rather large margins.

Alice also has another problem.
Assume that she can provide this verifiable data.
Alice and Bob do not want that this data ties them to the demonstration, 
because then Eve can use this data to find out about Alice and Bob and arrest 
them.
Thus, what Alice and Bob need is a system which can provide data authenticity 
and user privacy, i.e.\ that the data can be correctly tied to the 
demonstration without outing Alice and Bob as supporters.
