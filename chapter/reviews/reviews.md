    "Particular to your abstract we found that it may be the case of narrowing 
    down a bit the scope of the chapter as it feels still a bit too broad.  It 
    is also important to bare in mind the book will be read by a very 
    heterogeneous audience, from all sort of social studies background. The 
    text should thus should be accessible as possible and proofread before 
    submission."

General
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) 'readership'. The text lacks proofreading but more than that it is not         
clear to which audience it is directed. There are parts where the language        
is, for example, too technical for a larger audience. Adding footnotes here       
and there would be of great help.                                                 
                                                                                  
2) One of the reviewers makes an important point about fascist movements.         
Technologies should not be seen as having inherently or exclusively               
liberatory potentials.                                                            
                                                                                  
3) It would be a good idea to re-write the intro to better situate the            
chapter. We are fine with the 'manual' style, but it needs to acknowledge         
how technologies are extensions of social actors - whether its gov'ts,            
fascists, or anti-fascists.  The problem with the 'manual' style - as one         
of the reviewers pointed out - is that we might be providing info for             
fascists.                                                                         
                                                                                  
4) The last part of the article on "after protests" is not really about           
privacy-enhancement. It would be interesting to see it better connect to          
the general idea of the text.


Review #1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General comment

This is an interesting article on the use of Privacy enhancing Tools
for supporting the organisation of protest activities. In this sense,
qua topic it fits with the theme of the book.

Although at times the article ventures into complex technological
territory, the examples used to clarify these technologies seem well
chosen and work well to increase intelligibility.

Structurally the paper is also well organized around the protest life
cycle.  I do however have some general comments about the paper.  First,
there is a question of general approach that needs to be discussed in
the context of this book.

The article could mainly be seen as manual of privacy tools that
can be used for protest. In this sense it is more about advocacy than
analysis. There is limited attention for the concept and nature of this
protest. The phenomena of protest is by itself not analysed, but rather
taken for granted as something that needs to be facilitated.

Whereas this is definitively something that could be argued for in case
of dissidents and protest in authoritarian oppressive regimes, one could
also argue that these technologies equally facilitate organisation of
less morally praiseworthy networks, like fascist or jihad movements. The
article does not raise awareness with regard to these aspects when
articulating security wired infrastructures.

This becomes clear in the way only one scenario is used in the paper (of
which different aspects are then analysed): a case of gender protester
Alice against a totalitarian government.

But let’s tinker with the scenario. Let us replace ‘Alice’ by
the fascist ‘Klaus’ in most of the scenarios and the totalitarian
government with, let’s say the UK government. And let us substitute
the aim of peaceful protest with organising a violent street riot or a
coordinated attack on a well-guarded state agency or immigrant centre.

This shows that there is more socio-political complexity to these issues
beyond laying down the technological infrastructure.

Perhaps this point deserves some attention for the purpose of this book.

Although this seems primarily an article in the field of information
security, the link with protest and activism however does call for
some reflection on such socio- political aspects. In this sense I
would say that from a political theoretical perspective the article
is underdeveloped.

Second, there is also some unclarity about the nature of the contribution
of this article. The authors seem to claim they have themselves developed
the PETs they propose for protest ("In this chapter we will describe
some privacy-enhancing tools that we have developed and that we believe
are useful in the context of protesting" (p. 5)), but afterwards they
seem to mainly mobilize a host of tools developed by different people,
thus taking them from the state of the art (the reviewer cannot check
this given the anonymized nature of the paper).

I guess in this sense the contribution of this article would reside
in mobilizing and presenting existing PET tools for the community of
protesters, provide them with a manual so to say.

Furthermore, some more concrete comments have been made in the text
itself.  There are also still quite a few grammatical mistakes.


Review #2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments: 

First, I think the piece is very important and thoughtful. It identifies a
very real problem that needs good technical solutions. It probes at a set
of questions that have been largely ignored by the mainstream security
community, and it is a very hard set of questions—politically, sure,
but also mathematically, scientifically.

At the same time, I think it may be lacking a degree of focus in
terms of its purpose. It is unclear to me who its audience is:
activists? academics? computer scientists?

If the piece is intended for a technical audience (like a computer
science journal) it may not be the right fit for this specific book. If
the piece is included in the book however, then from my perspective,
the technical explanations (for example, of public key crypto) are either
(a) too long if the reader is assumed to have any technical background or
(b) go into too much detail for non-technical audiences.

I would also say that the text could use a good editor in terms of
language (there is a lot of passive voice and it can be difficult to
follow in some places).

In keeping with the author’s comment in their conclusion regarding the
need to face the “engineer’s disease” of failing to thoroughly
analyze user needs before providing technical solutions, I’ve tried
to reflect on my own experiences organizing large scale demonstration
before writing this review.

In that light, I’m not convinced that some of the needs identified by
the author are real, or if they are, whether they are the most pressing
ones faced by protest organizers and participants. I think there needs
to be more empirical evidence referenced in the paper which substantiates
the author’s choices to that effect.

I would therefore encourage her/him to seek out academic research related
to these issues, or perhaps look for some kind of needs assessment
type documentation emerging from social justice communities. What are
the real problems faced by anti-authoritarian activists attempting to
organize demonstrations in the Middle East, for example? I am also not
sure that the ‘after a protest’ section is complete: while combating
misinformation is important, there are also challenging problems in terms
of what to do if a participant is arrested or disappears that may have
technical implications, and are not covered here.

I would also encourage the author to engage in a critical reflection
about whether technical solutions are in fact always the most effective or
efficient solutions to the problems faced by these groups (for example,
is it realistic that activists would seek out otherwise-strangers as
outlined in section 2.1 to organize public demonstrations using a digital
tool like this?)
