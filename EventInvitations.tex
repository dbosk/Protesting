\subsection{Inviting Participants}
\label{InvitingParticipants}

%For the scheduling of a protest, there are in turn several problems that must 
%be addressed.
%From the organizer Alice's perspective, she wants to protect herself from being 
%arrested for organizing a protest.
%So Alice needs to protect herself from the possible participants, as one of 
%them can be agent Eve of the intelligence services of the regime.
%From the participant Bob's perspective, he wants to protect himself from being 
%arrested for committing to participate in a protest.
%So Bob needs to protect himself from the organizer and the other participants, 
%as any of them can be Eve.
%
%When organizing a protest, what Alice and Bob want to agree on is a time, 
%a place and to ensure enough people will show up at that time and place.
%Alice and Bob also want Eve to learn as little as possible of the plans so 
%that she cannot curtail the protest.
%
%\citet{EventsInvitations} presented a distributed protocol for event 
%invitations.
%This protocol does not require any \ac{TTP} and allows for different privacy 
%settings:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Alice discloses nothing to Bob, except the time and the place;
%\item Alice discloses everything --- who the invitees are, who of those have 
%  already committed etc.;
%\item and every combination of settings in between.
%\end{itemize}
%Further, if Alice breaks her promises, Bob has a proof which he can publish to 
%everyone to show that Alice cheated.
%Likewise, if Bob commits to attending, Alice has proof that Bob has done so and 
%can show to everyone that Bob isn't present although he said he would.
%This is useful input to a reputation system.
%
%One topic that must be explored is to adapt this protocol to introduce 
%deniability.
%Another interesting feature to include would be the choice of location.
%With this, all participants can jointly agree on not only a time, but also 
%a location.
%This would help against the problem of announcing the location in advance.

Alice wants to organize a demonstration.
A demonstration requires participants to have any effect, so Alice wants to 
invite Bob and Carol to participate in her demonstration.
There is one major issue here: trust.
Alice must ensure that Bob and Carol learn enough information to attend.
In case Bob or Carol collaborates (voluntarily or involuntarily) with Eve, 
neither should have enough information for Eve to prevent the demonstration.
Bob and Carol on the other hand, they want to ensure that Alice is not 
(collaborating with) Eve and that the invitation is not an attempt to trick 
them to \enquote{incriminate} themselves as conspirators against the regime.
\Textcite{EventsInvitations} has done some work in the direction of solving 
this problem with a fully decentralized scheme.

%There are some tasks that the organizers must accomplish prior to the protest 
%itself.
%For example, they must decide who are the most suitable candidates to attend 
%the event, how to let them know about the protest and what preliminary 
%information they should get.
%They must also decide whether invitees should learn about the attendance of 
%other invitees or not.
%Preferably, all this should be possible in a privacy-preserving
%fashion. %TODO: reviewer: unclear

Realizing this standard feature of \acp{OSN} in a decentralized manner is not 
trivial, because there is no trusted third party which both organizers and 
invitees can rely on. %TODO: reviewer comment: give more concrete
                      %examples, like FB, analyze why FB has flaws
Since they %TODO: who?
 all depend on only themselves, an implementation of this feature 
must provide security properties that guarantee fairness to all parties 
involved, e.g.\  a protester can verify that the invitation she received was 
actually sent by the organizers.
Moreover, the implementation should also provide privacy settings to protect 
personal information such as the identities of the participants, e.g.\ the 
organizers can restrict to only the invited participants to learn how many 
others have been invited, and only after a protester has agreed and committed 
formally to attend the event, she can learn the identities of other invited 
protesters.

The challenge of implementing this feature without a trusted third party 
becomes greater when the organizers want to allow different types of 
information about the event to be shared with different groups of protesters in 
a secure way because any participant should be able to verify the results to 
detect any possible cheating.
For example, a neutral trusted broker, such as the organizers, could keep 
certain information secret, such as the identities of the invited protesters, 
and only disclose it to those ones who commit to attend the protest. 

In the scheme by \citet{EventsInvitations}, they describe and formalize the 
security and privacy properties outlined above.
More specifically, that the organizer is able to configure who can learn the 
identities of the invited or attending participants, or a more restrictive 
version where only the number of invitees or attendees are revealed.
There is also an attendee-only property that guarantees exclusive access to 
some data, e.g.\ the location of the protest.
These properties are accomplished using several simple primitives:
storage location indirection, controlled ciphertext inference and 
a commit-disclose protocol.
Storage location indirection allows the organizer to control not only who can 
read some the contents of some encrypted data, but also who can access the 
ciphertext.
% XXX Why is this interesting?
Controlled ciphertext inference can be used by the organizer to allow for 
controlled information leaks.
This is needed to achieve properties such as revealing the number of invitees 
but keeping their identities secret.
Finally, the commit-disclose protocol can make some secret available for only 
those participants who committed to attend the protest while, at the same time, 
detect any misbehaving party.
