Due to decentralization we must also handle the problem of \emph{one} person 
having \emph{multiple identities}.
This is a problem present in reputation systems and is generally known as the 
problem of Sybil attacks.
In many of the topcis we will treat throughout the chapter, this problem must 
be solved.
So we will first give an overview of the results relating to this problem.

It has been proven impossible to solve without \emph{logically} central control 
of the creation of identities~\cite{SybilAttack}.
