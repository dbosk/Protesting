\section{General Attacks against Activists}
\label{GeneralAttacks}

In general, there are some more properties that are relevant for these systems.
Some secure authentication schemes allows for \ac{DoS} attacks against the 
proper account holder.
Although it prevents the attacker from gaining access, it also prevents the 
authentic user:
e.g.\ what should happen if multiple users try to access an account at the same 
time?
If the intelligence services can lock the activists out of their accounts and 
thus forcing them to resolve to less secure means of communication, then the 
intelligence services have won.
\citet{P2PPasswords} developed mechanisms towards solving this problem.
