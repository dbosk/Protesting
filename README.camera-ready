The main TeX-file is `protesting.tex`.

That file contains the preamble and the `document` environment. The actual 
contents is then `\input`ed from the other files.

The document uses `biblatex` and `biber` for the references and bibliography.

The document can be compiled as it is using
```
latexmk protesting.tex
```
and the latest version of TeXLive in Ubuntu. (More specifically, the acro 
package must be v2.3 or later, we used v2.7. The others should be fine.)
