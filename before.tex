\section{Before a Protest}
\label{BeforeProtest}

We are interested in solving several problems before a protest.
Essentially, the goal in this stage is to organize a protest, once we have 
solved this problem we can move on to having a protest.
Organizing a protest introduces several problems that must be solved.
Assume that Alice wants to organize a protest, then she must solve at least the 
following problems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Alice must find other interested people, i.e.\ potential fellow 
    organizers.
  \item The organizers must be able to communicate securely with each other.
  \item Alice must \enquote{spread the word} to other interested people, i.e.\ 
    potential participants.
  \item Finally, Alice and everyone interested must agree on a time and a place
    to have the protest.
\end{enumerate}

Finding other people who have similar interests can be difficult in general.
It is even more difficult if the interests are not socially accepted, e.g.\ 
being HBTQ or wanting change in a totalitarian regime.
These interests can be punished by death in several countries.
Thus Alice is very reluctant to reveal her interests in organizing a protest 
against the regime, the consequences of talking to the wrong person can be 
severe.
There are technical solutions which can make this easier, we will discuss these 
in \cref{UserSearch}.

Once Alice has found some people who has expressed interest she can proceed to 
the next problem.
We say \enquote{expressed interest} since there is no way for Alice to ensure 
this, a person can always lie about their interests to Alice.
This brings us to Alice's privacy expectations for communication.
The organizers do not want the regime's intelligence services to identify them 
as such.
We will discuss two-party conversations in \cref{Communicating}.
However, sometimes we desire a discussion between more than two participants at 
a time.
We will focus on this in \cref{Discussions}.

Eventually it is time for the protest.
None of the organizers and none of the participants want to show up for 
a demonstration alone or with just a few others.
This would make them an easy prey for the regime.
We will discuss the different aspects of scheduling the event in 
\cref{Scheduling}, i.e.\ choosing a time and a place, committing to participate 
etc.

Finally, many of these techniques requires the user to authenticate in some 
way.
This means that a user must keep their credentials.
This can be done by storing keys in a device, such as a smartphone.
However, a device can be lost and, as was lately shown~\cite{AppleVsFBI}, can 
easily attract attacks.
We will discuss the aspects of how to protect \enquote{accounts} and data in 
the decentralized setting in \cref{passwd}.

\subsection{Scheduling a Protest}
\label{Scheduling}

For the scheduling of a protest, there are in turn several problems that must 
be addressed.
From the organizer Alice's perspective, she wants to protect herself from being 
arrested for organizing a protest.
So Alice needs to protect herself from the possible participants, as one of 
them can be agent Eve of the intelligence services of the regime.
From the participant Bob's perspective, he wants to protect himself from being 
arrested for committing to participate in a protest.
So Bob needs to protect himself from the organizer and the other participants, 
as any of them can be Eve.

When organizing a protest, what Alice and Bob want to agree on is a time, 
a place and to ensure enough people will show up at that time and place.
Alice and Bob also want Eve to learn as little as possible of the plans so 
that she cannot curtail the protest.

\citet{EventsInvitations} presented a distributed protocol without the need of 
\iac{TTP}.
This protocol allows for different privacy settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alice discloses nothing to Bob, except the time and the place;
\item Alice discloses everything --- who the invitees are, who of those have 
  already committed etc.;
\item and every combination of settings in between.
\end{itemize}
Further, if Alice doesn't keep her promises, Bob has a proof which he can 
publish to everyone to show that Alice cheated.
Likewise, if Bob commits to attending, Alice has proof that Bob has done so and 
can show to everyone that Bob isn't present although he said he would.

One topic that must be explored is to adapt this protocol to introduce 
deniability.
Another interesting feature to include would be the choice of location.
With this, all participants can jointly agree on not only a time, but also 
a location.
This would help against the problem of announcing the location in advance.
