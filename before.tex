\section{Before a Demonstration}
\label{BeforeProtest}

Alice is an activist in an authoritarian regime and she want to organize 
a demonstration.
This means that the regime wants to stop Alice while she prepares the 
demonstration.
Consequently, Alice wants to do all preparations in such a way that she 
minimizes the risk of interference.
In this section we will focus on two aspects: the communication between the 
activists and their agreement on the details of the demonstration event.

\paragraph{Communication}

Alice and her co-organizers must communicate with each other.
A trivial solution to the communication problem is the traditional face-to-face 
meeting --- with the trade-off that the invited attendants should be able to 
meet at the same time in the same place.
This is not always easy to achieve, so Alice wants to complement this by 
electronic communications.
Thus Alice wants to communicate with Bob by means of a secure channel to 
prevent the regime's agents from eavesdropping on their conversations.

Secure communication can be divided into two problems: bootstrapping and the 
actual communication.
There are several tools that we will discuss related to this.
In \cref{UserSearch}, we will discuss how Alice and Bob can find each other in 
\iac{DOSN}, this relates to the bootstrapping problem.
Then we discuss security and privacy properties of the communication problem, 
we focus on two-party secure communications in \cref{Communicating}.
There is also the case where Alice wants to talk to more people than just Bob, 
and this case is discussed in \cref{Discussions}.

\paragraph{Agreement}

Alice and the co-organizers must agree on a time and place to hold the 
demonstration.
This can also be extended to including interested participants.
For example, the organizers might be interested in estimating how many invited 
participants are really committed to attend the event, but in such a way that 
they do not reveal the details --- which the regime can use to thwart it --- 
such as the location and any identities.
At the same time, the participants who have committed to attend may want to 
have assurances that they will be told the details of the protest if they 
express their commitment to the organizers.

We discuss some aspects of this problem in \cref{Scheduling}.
The main issue here is trust.
And as pointed out in \cref{SybilAttacks}, this is a notoriously difficult 
problem in electronic systems.

\subsection{Scheduling an Event}
\label{Scheduling}

%For the scheduling of a protest, there are in turn several problems that must 
%be addressed.
%From the organizer Alice's perspective, she wants to protect herself from being 
%arrested for organizing a protest.
%So Alice needs to protect herself from the possible participants, as one of 
%them can be agent Eve of the intelligence services of the regime.
%From the participant Bob's perspective, he wants to protect himself from being 
%arrested for committing to participate in a protest.
%So Bob needs to protect himself from the organizer and the other participants, 
%as any of them can be Eve.
%
%When organizing a protest, what Alice and Bob want to agree on is a time, 
%a place and to ensure enough people will show up at that time and place.
%Alice and Bob also want Eve to learn as little as possible of the plans so 
%that she cannot curtail the protest.
%
%\citet{EventsInvitations} presented a distributed protocol for event 
%invitations.
%This protocol does not require any \ac{TTP} and allows for different privacy 
%settings:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Alice discloses nothing to Bob, except the time and the place;
%\item Alice discloses everything --- who the invitees are, who of those have 
%  already committed etc.;
%\item and every combination of settings in between.
%\end{itemize}
%Further, if Alice breaks her promises, Bob has a proof which he can publish to 
%everyone to show that Alice cheated.
%Likewise, if Bob commits to attending, Alice has proof that Bob has done so and 
%can show to everyone that Bob isn't present although he said he would.
%This is useful input to a reputation system.
%
%One topic that must be explored is to adapt this protocol to introduce 
%deniability.
%Another interesting feature to include would be the choice of location.
%With this, all participants can jointly agree on not only a time, but also 
%a location.
%This would help against the problem of announcing the location in advance.
