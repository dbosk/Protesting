\section{Before a Protest}
\label{BeforeProtest}
Organizing a protest in a privacy-preserving manner does not come for free. There 
are many trade-offs to consider in our decentralized scenario for Alice, who wants 
to organize a protest, but also for the potential co-organizers and participants.

\paragraph{Participation}
Assuming that Alice will want to protest in a collective manner (not alone), she 
will have to find interested people whom she can co-organize the event with. Later 
on, to participate in the protest itself.

% TODO 'socially' is not the right word I think (gurc)
Although finding people with similar interests can be a difficult task in general, 
doing so when the interests are not socially or legally accepted can be much more 
difficult if not impossible. For example, diversity of sexuality and gender identity 
are denied and even severely punished in some totalitarian regimes, making Alice 
very reluctant to reveal such condition when trying to organize a protest against 
the regime. The plausible severe consequences for Alice to find a co-organizer, 
Bob, who deliberately supports and reports to the government of the regime such 
circumstance may oblige Alice to censor herself. 

In \cref{UserSearch} we discuss a technical solution that can make the task of finding
co-organizers and potentially interested participants in a privacy-preserving manner 
for all parties. However, there is no technology nor solution to ensure that Bob 
is not lying to Alice about his interests. Therefore, we will use the term \enquote{expressed 
interest} when referring to the common interest between Alice and Bob revealed by 
the latter to the former. 

\paragraph{Communication}
Alice and the other co-organizers will have to communicate with each other. Moreover, 
Alice and the co- organizers will want to spread the word about the protest to other 
potential participants.

A trivial solution to the communication problem is the traditional face to face 
meeting. Though one of the main trade-offs is the need for synchronisation between 
the invited attendants should be able to meet at the same time in the same place. 
If the synchronicity requirement is not that strict, then a way to communicate the 
outcome of the meeting to those who did not attend is necessary (and vice versa).

The physical communication can be supplemented using some sort of channel that provides 
both off-line and real time communication capabilities, and guarantees the identity 
of each party using the channel.

Thus we assume that Alice will also want to communicate with Bob by means of a secure 
channel to avoid any non-verified third party, for example, the governmental intelligence 
agency, to eavesdrop on her conversations. Such two-parties secure communications 
we discuss in \cref{Communicating}, while in the case of more than two participants 
we describe in \cref{Discussions}.

\paragraph{Agreement}
Alice and the organizers, and every participant interested should agree on a 
time and a place to have the protest.

Eventually it is time for the protest.
None of the organizers and none of the participants want to show up for 
a demonstration alone or with just a few others.
This would make them an easy prey for the regime.
We will discuss the different aspects of scheduling the event in 
\cref{Scheduling}, i.e.\ choosing a time and a place, committing to participate 
etc.

\paragraph{Authentication}
Finally, many of these techniques requires the user to authenticate in some 
way.
This means that a user must keep their credentials.
This can be done by storing keys in a device, such as a smartphone.
However, a device can be lost and, as was lately shown~\cite{AppleVsFBI}, can 
easily attract attacks.
We will discuss the aspects of how to protect \enquote{accounts} and data in 
the decentralized setting in \cref{passwd}.

\subsection{Scheduling a Protest}
\label{Scheduling}

For the scheduling of a protest, there are in turn several problems that must 
be addressed.
From the organizer Alice's perspective, she wants to protect herself from being 
arrested for organizing a protest.
So Alice needs to protect herself from the possible participants, as one of 
them can be agent Eve of the intelligence services of the regime.
From the participant Bob's perspective, he wants to protect himself from being 
arrested for committing to participate in a protest.
So Bob needs to protect himself from the organizer and the other participants, 
as any of them can be Eve.

When organizing a protest, what Alice and Bob want to agree on is a time, 
a place and to ensure enough people will show up at that time and place.
Alice and Bob also want Eve to learn as little as possible of the plans so 
that she cannot curtail the protest.

\citet{EventsInvitations} presented a distributed protocol without the need of 
\iac{TTP}.
This protocols allows for different privacy settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alice discloses nothing to Bob, except the time and the place;
\item Alice discloses everything --- who the invitees are, who of those have 
  already committed etc.;
\item and every combination of settings in between.
\end{itemize}
Further, if Alice doesn't keep her promises, Bob has a proof which he can 
publish to everyone to show that Alice cheated.
Likewise, if Bob commits to attending, Alice has proof that Bob has done so and 
can show to everyone that Bob isn't present although he said he would.

One topic that must be explored is to adapt this protocol to introduce 
deniability.
Another interesting feature to include would be the choice of location.
With this, all participants can jointly agree on not only a time, but also 
a location.
This would help against the problem of announcing the location in advance.
