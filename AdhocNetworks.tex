The area of ad-hoc networks is far too wide for us to convey more than the 
general idea of the field in this chapter, we refer the reader to e.g.\ 
\textcite{AdHocNetworksBook} for details.
The idea of ad-hoc networks is to form a network using ad-hoc connections.
For example, if Alice can communicate with Bob, Bob in turn can communicate 
with both Alice and Carol, then Alice can communicate with Carol through Bob.
Protesters can use this technique to form an ad-hoc network at the physical 
location of the demonstration, thus avoiding the government-controlled 
telephone network.
Depending on the reach of the ad-hoc network, participants might get access to 
the global Internet through some node in the network.
If not, they are limited to communicating only between themselves.
