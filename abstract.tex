We give an overview of some possible future technologies that can be used for 
protests.
We focus on privacy-preserving tools that can be used before, under and after 
a protest:
\begin{itemize}
  \item before, to organize a public protest;
  \item during, for the organizers and participants to communicate, within 
    the group or to the outside world;
  \item after, possibly following up an event by verifying the participation 
    and computing verifiable statistics, e.g.\ how many participants and in 
    what area.
\end{itemize}
