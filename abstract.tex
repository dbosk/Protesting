While technologies for coordination and communication, such as online social networks, exist, they can endanger political activists when the control over their data is ceded to third parties. For technology to be useful for activism, it needs to be trustworthy and protect the users' privacy; only then can it be viewed as a potential improvement over more traditional offline methods.  We believe activists could benefit from new technologies that facilitate protest organization while protecting their privacy.  Here, we discuss a selection from a Computer Science perspective in an effort to open a dialog and elicit input from other perspectives.

% We give an overview of some possible future technologies that can be used for 
% protests.
% We focus on privacy-preserving tools that can be used before, under and after 
% a protest:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item before, to organize a public protest;
%   \item during, for the organizers and participants to communicate, within 
%     the group or to the outside world;
%   \item after, for organizers to follow up an event by verifying the participation 
%     and computing verifiable statistics, e.g.\ how many participants and in 
%     what area.
% \end{itemize}
